### Usage

| keys                             | function                                     |
| :---:                            | :---:                                        |
| hjkl(vim bindings) or arrow keys | scroll/enter/exit a directory                |
| o or \<ENTER\>                   | go to directory/open file under cursor       |
| i                                | go to current directory(in left side window) |
| q                                | quit                                         |
| /                                | search                                       |
| n / N                            | jump to the next / previous search match     |
| Ctrl + U / Ctrl + D              | half pageup / pagedown                       |

To open up a directory with trans
```bash
ts /usr/lib/
ts ..
ts /root
```

<br/>

### config file

located at

```bash
~/.tsrc
```

**if `~/.tsrc` doesn't exist, you need to create one**

It supports changing the editor (opened with `o` or `ENTER`) and the theme.

An example of `~/.tsrc`:

```tsrc
# Set your preferred editor
editor = emacs

# Set your preferred theme
theme = dark
```

#### Editor

The specified editor will open when `o` or `ENTER` is pressed while the cursor is on a file.

The default editor is `vi`.

#### Theme

The default theme is `lucius`.

`dark` theme:

* [vscode](https://github.com/Mofiqul/vscode.nvim)

### Search

Now supports `>> regular expression <<`

`Trangender.rs` performs a search whenever a key is pressed in search mode

Due to the use of the `regex-lite` crate, the executable can be a bit bloated (
~504KB). If you don't need the regular expression feature, simply switch to the
vanilla version by checking out to the vanilla branch and building
`Transgender.rs` from there.

```bash
git checkout vanilla
make
make install
```

<br/>

### uninstall

if you want to uninstall `Transgender.rs`
```
make uninstall
```

<br/>

### Features:

* File exploration
* Changing directories
* Searching by file name
* Opening files with a preferred editor
* Multiple themes

```
WHY DID I MAKE TRANS?

In my opinion, Trans is simpler than ranger. Creeping
featurism and growing size have made ranger less
attractive. Additionally, ranger is not a good
software; it is filled with bad designs that irritate
its users.
